Simple Stock Calculator is a web app that will be used by everyday investors looking to easily predict gains or losses from security transactions. 

We feel that current stock profit calculating websites are either overly complicated or visually unappealing. With Simple Stock Calculator we set out to bridge the gaps between functionality, ease-of-use, and visual appeal. 

Simple Stock Calculator is in no way responsible for any realized profits or losses and should only be used as a hypothetical assessment of security trades.
